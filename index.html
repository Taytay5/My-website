        <h3>Taylor</h3>
        <p>My name is Taylor Marie Petereit. I am 14, my birthday is May 5, 2005. I was born at 2:16am at Mount Carmel East Hospital. I am a freshman at Licking Heights High Highschool. I am very short, I am 5'2. I have red and dark brown hair, and green eyes. My parents have been seperated since I was 2 years old and I have 2 half brothers that live at my dads house. After I graduate highschool I hope to go to college for 8 years to become a labor and delivery nurse. I want to get married when I am at least 21 and then I want to get a big house and potenially have 3 kids. I want twin boys and a girl. I also want to get a husky, which is my dream dog, a rottweiler, and a german shepard.</p>
