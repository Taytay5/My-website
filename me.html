          <h2>My favorite things and things I like to do</h2>
          <p>Some of my favorite things to do are to watch Netflix, play on my phone, babysit, and play soccer. I love to watch netflix. On Netflix I watch lots of TV shows, and movies, most of which are scary. Most of the tv shows that I watch, iv’e watched more than once, some more than three times. Some of my favorite movies to watch are After, The Conjuring, and Would You Rather. Some of my favorite tv shows to watch are Riverdale, Big Mouth, and Orange Is The New Black. Another thing that I love to do is to babysit. On my phone I am normally on snapchat texting people, or looking at peoples stories, or I am on instagram. I got my babysitting license last year. I have not babysat any babies yet, but I am going to start babysitting a baby regularly soon. The baby is 6 month old girl, and she has a 5 year old brother that I might babysit over the summer. I played soccer for Pataskala’s rec group for two years. Twice in the spring and once in the fall. In soccer I played defense which was my favorite, forward, and midfield, which was my least favorite position that I played. My favorite food is chicken. I love plain chicken, chicken quesadillas, anything that has chicken. My favorite drink is either water or snapple; the apple flavor. I like to put lemon juice in my water to give it a little flavor. My favorite board game to play is either clue or life. My favorite team is Ohio State, at my dads house both my brother's room and my room are Ohio State themed. Each one of my walls is painted a different color; red, black, white, and gray, and in my brother's room, one of there walls is a football field that my dad painted, on another are red and gray diamonds, and the last 2 are painted the colors of the buckeyes helmets. My favorite colors are teal or grey, and my favorite animal is a elephant.</p>
