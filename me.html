          <h2>My favorite things and things I like to do</h2>
          <p>Some of my favorite things to do are to watch Netflix, babysit, and play soccer. I love to watch netflix. On Netflix I watch lots of TV shows, and movies. Most of the tv shows that I watch, iv’e watched more than once, some more than three times. Another thing that I love to do is to babysit. I got my babysitting license last year and have been babysitting ever since. I mostly babysit babies or toddlers. I don’t like to babysit older kids because one I am young and two they don’t listen very well. I babysit three babies and one toddler. The babies are all the girls that are six to eleven months old, and the toddler is one and a half. I played soccer for Pataskala’s rec group for two years. In soccer I played defense which was my favorite, forward, and midfield which was my least favorite that I played. My favorite food is chicken. I love plain chicken, chicken quesadillas, anything that has chicken. My favorite animal is an elephant, in my room at my moms I have elephants everywhere. My favorite drink is either water or snapple; the apple flavor. I like to put lemon juice in my water to give it a little flavor. My favorite board game to play is either clue or life. My favorite team is Ohio State, at my dads house both my brother's room and my room are Ohio State themed. Each one of my walls is painted a different color; red, black, white, and gray, and in my brother's room, one of there walls is a football field that my dad painted, on another are red and gray diamonds, and the last 2 are painted the colors of the buckeyes helmets. I don't have a favorite movie or tv shows but I love anything scary</p>
